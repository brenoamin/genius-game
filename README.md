# Genius Game using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This GitHub repository contains my semester project for the Object-Oriented Programming course. The project focuses on recreating the popular 1980s game called Genius (also known as Simon). The objective is to explore various concepts related to programming and OOP using the Python programming language.

The key concepts covered in this project include:

- Python Language: The project extensively utilizes the Python programming language for implementation. <br>
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: The project emphasizes the principles and concepts of OOP, such as classes, constructors, methods, attributes, self-references, and objects. <br>
- Static Typing: The project leverages static typing, a feature available in Python, to enhance code reliability and maintainability. <br>
- Object-Oriented Modeling: The project explores the process of modeling the game's components and interactions using an object-oriented approach. <br>


By working on this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of Python, strengthen my grasp of OOP principles, and apply them to a real-world scenario. The repository will serve as a comprehensive record of my project's source code, documentation, and any additional resources related to the development process.

Feel free to explore the repository to gain insights into the implementation of the Genius game using Python and the application of OOP concepts. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are highly appreciated.

Let the game begin, and let the genius within you shine!
