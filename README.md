# Genius Game using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This GitHub repository contains my semester project for the Object-Oriented Programming course. The project focuses on recreating the popular 1980s game called Genius (also known as Simon). The objective is to explore various concepts related to programming and OOP using the Python programming language.

The key concepts covered in this project include:

- Python Language: The project extensively utilizes the Python programming language for implementation. <br>
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: The project emphasizes the principles and concepts of OOP, such as classes, constructors, methods, attributes, self-references, and objects. <br>
- Static Typing: The project leverages static typing, a feature available in Python, to enhance code reliability and maintainability. <br>
- Object-Oriented Modeling: The project explores the process of modeling the game's components and interactions using an object-oriented approach. <br>


By working on this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of Python, strengthen my grasp of OOP principles, and apply them to a real-world scenario. The repository will serve as a comprehensive record of my project's source code, documentation, and any additional resources related to the development process.

Feel free to explore the repository to gain insights into the implementation of the Genius game using Python and the application of OOP concepts. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are highly appreciated.

Let the game begin, and let the genius within you shine!

# Instructions on how to use the program

Just like the classic game Genius (Simon), our game consists of trying to memorize a sequence of colors that is randomly generated during the game. How to start playing? Click the Start button on the screen and press it, fasten your seatbelts, prepare your memory, and patiently wait for the light signal; the first sequence will be easy. Once you see the color, press the button you think flashed sequentially, the order matters. So, have you managed to get past 10 colors? If you make a mistake, don't be sad, read the message displayed on the screen, click on the game, and ask for a new sequence; there's always room to go further!

# For each team member, a description of their contribution, as well as a rating from 0 to 5 indicating their level of contribution to the project:

Breno Amin was responsible for conceptualizing the game, creating the repository with their respective descriptions, organizing the interface in Tupy, conceptualizing the modules used in the project, researching benchmarks, reviewing the constructed codes, creating the Button class, and actively contributing to the Game class, as well as building all on-screen animations. -> Rating: 5

Isaac Araújo was involved in the game's conceptualization and planning, and participated in building all the game's classes, particularly the StartButton, ColoredButton(), and Game() classes. Additionally, Isaac reviewed and fixed errors related to class typings. -> Rating: 5

Júlio Ângelo contributed to building the images that composed the interface, implemented docstrings, encapsulation, and reviewed the codes. -> Rating: 4

Pedro Magalhães was responsible for taking care of project encapsulation, as well as implementing the necessary typings, considering `mypy --strict`. -> Rating: 3.5

## How to setup the project:

-  Install and configure python on your local machine
- Download the Tupy: Tupy is a graphical environment in which people can experiment with Python objects. It is inspired by Java's Greenfoot. Visit the  [Tupy documentation](https://github.com/rodrigorgs/tupy)
- Install the tupy environment running  `pip install git+https://github.com/rodrigorgs/tupy.git`
- Go to the main file and run `python main.py`
